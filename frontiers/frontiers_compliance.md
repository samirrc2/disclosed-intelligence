## Items requiring your input before submission (3)
1. **Affiliation** — the block reads "Independent Researcher, New York, NY, United States" for both authors (matching your Paper 13 submission); confirm or adjust to your preferred wording.
2. **Zenodo + Code Ocean DOIs** — insert into the Data Availability Statement (and `CITATION.cff`, `.zenodo.json`) once you mint the release; the GitHub link is already in place.
3. **Portal steps** — per-figure alt text, corresponding-author registration, and (if requested) the words/figures/tables count field.

## Verified at compile
`pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex×2` compiles with **0 errors**, **0 undefined citations**, 37 references formatted in Harvard style, line + page numbers present, 18 pages. Files to upload: `manuscript.tex`, `references.bib`, `manuscript.pdf`, `figures/fig1–4.png` (individual copies in `submission/Figure1–4.png`), and the class/style files (`FrontiersinHarvard.cls`, `Frontiers-Harvard.bst`, logos) if the portal compiles.
